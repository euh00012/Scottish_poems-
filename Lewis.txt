In the heart of the Hebrides, where the sea whispers tales,
Lies the Isle of Lewis, where beauty never pales.
A tapestry of green, with heather-kissed hills,
Where nature's magic dances, and time stands still.

Oh, Lewis, adorned in hues of emerald and gold,
Majestic landscapes, a story to be told.
The Callanish Stones, ancient sentinels of lore,
Guardians of mysteries, on the rugged shore.

As Atlantic waves embrace the rocky coast,
Legends echo, of heroes and ghosts.
A symphony of seabirds, a chorus in flight,
Painting the skies with hues of twilight.

The peat-scented air, a fragrance so divine,
In the Lewis moors, where heather and brine entwine.
Lochs mirror the heavens, reflecting the stars,
Whispers of old tales, carried afar.

Crofters in harmony with the land they tend,
A timeless bond, that will never end.
Woolen threads weave stories of resilience and grace,
In the looms of tradition, a heritage to embrace.

Castles and ruins, standing against the gales,
Witness to history, where time unveils.
Through ancient ruins, whispers of the past,
Lewis, a treasure trove, a home for me.

In the quietude of Lewis, where time finds its reprieve,
Nature's masterpiece, a haven to believe.
As the northern lights dance in the midnight sky,
The Isle of Lewis, where dreams and reality lie.
